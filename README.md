# CIBSR2016
This is the project I worked on during my internship at Stanford Med School's Center for Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research. 

About the project and its importance to me:

It was just a screen filled with ones and zeros, but the sight thrilled me. This particular configuration of binary digits emerged from a program I had written to identify blurry, unusable frames in an MRI scan and transform them into a format that other MRI analysis software can read. While the researchers I met at my internship might not consider this achievement earth-shattering, I was euphoric. My team was one step closer to understanding the biological puzzle of Turner Syndrome thanks to my emerging computer science skills. Inspired by the prospect of alleviating Turner symptoms, I was making the world a better place, and this was just the beginning.

My epiphany would not surprise those who know me well. I’ve always loved puzzles; I led family jigsaw marathons. In eighth grade, I came to view biology as a collection of puzzles—if I solved one, I could better the lives of people with deadly diseases or chronic syndromes. Only when I took biology and computer science concurrently sophomore year did I realize that CS could prove a useful tool in solving these complex puzzles more quickly and effectively.

Some are motivated by fame or fortune. While I’m not ruling out the possibility of winning the Nobel Prize or founding the next Genentech, I’m in it to help repair our world. This is the value I’ve been raised with. That is what matters to me, for only in doing so can society come closer to healing the world completely.
